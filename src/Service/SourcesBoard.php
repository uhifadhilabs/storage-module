/**
 * WHICH MODULE PUTS A FILE HERE, AND WHAT IT CALLS ONE.
 *
 * THE TAB EXISTS BECAUSE THE REGISTER CANNOT ANSWER IT. Two of four installed
 * modules may store files and two may not, and the difference is invisible on
 * a list of files: a reader asking "why is Roster not here" has nowhere else
 * to look. So the rows are the INSTALLED MODULES, not the modules that
 * happen to hold something — a module that declares a file store and holds
 * nothing yet is drawn as storing nothing, and one that declares none is
 * drawn as declaring none, and those are different answers.
 *
 * THE CATALOGUE IS OPTIONAL. An installation may run this bundle without the
 * registry — the hub is a screen, not a per-area capability — and where the
 * catalogue is absent the board lists what declared itself and says nothing
 * about what did not. A row invented for a module nobody can confirm is
 * installed would be worse than a short list.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DECIDES WHO MAY SEE A FILE. The owning record does, always.
